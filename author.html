                            Johannes Meier is the author of "Change Management in the Age of AI" and has been teaching 
                            the course "Change Management in the Age of AI" for many years in the MBA programs at 
                            <strong>HHL Graduate School of Management</strong> in Leipzig.

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            This book distills the lectures from the course that Johannes has taught for many years. 
                            Given AI's rapid technological evolution, the course content is updated annually. Consequently, 
                            the book captures a fleeting snapshot of current technological developments and AI applications. 
                            Nevertheless, the fundamental principles and heuristics for navigating complex, nonlinear change 
                            at the individual, organizational, and societal levels remain enduring and robust across time.

                        <p>
                            The book was written with the support of many AI-agents based on GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and 
                            Gemini 3 Pro in a Cursor environment. These agents supported the author in researching references, 
                            prototyping applications, improving writing, creating infographics including the title page, getting 
                            critical editorial feedback, and typesetting the book. They took over many of the tedious tasks and 
                            left the author with the fun parts of writing this book. Working in this "hybrid team" was an amazing 
                            experience.
